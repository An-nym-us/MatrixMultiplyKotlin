# Overview

This program is designed to show the user the benefits of utilizing multithreaded calculations to enhance the speed at which programs can calculate large amounts of information at the same time verse sequentially calculating information. The reason why I decided to make this is that many people think in a linear fashion, but if you can utilize doing multiple tasks at the same time in an effective manner, you can go so much more completed in a short amount of time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to create this software were IntelliJ. I found this to be the vector IDE as it was very much molded around Kotlin as a programing language. There were not any external libraries that were required for this program to function. All tools were included in IntelliJ.
